### Hi there! Glad to see you in my profile!

I am a predominantly back-end developer, having started coding in college with the C++ language. Most of my coding experience stems from writing high-performant OOP algorithms for use in simulators which is an area of research in my college. With that strong basis, I started to venture around in my vacations with experimentations with other languages such as Python. It went so well, my final college project was written entirely in Python (You can find it in my repositories, search for Petro-Explorer). 

After programming for a while in Python, I began to miss some language features from C++ such as strong typing but I didn't want to give up on some comforts I had with Python such as a large number of easy-installable libraries, thus I was led into developing with C#. Since then, it has been a very pleasuring experience as I feel satisfied with the language and the .NET framework. Now I have been building things I would not imagine just two years ago, like developing APIs connected to No-SQL cloud databases or Web Applications (MVC Pattern).

I like Frond-End development too! However, that learning curve is a bit steep for me due to my back-end upbringing. I've always liked to do some design work on the side such as designing flyers, presentations, and so on. To combine that aptitude with software development is very fulfilling to me. Thus, I intend to close the skill gap and be able to build any kind of software.

Feel free to navigate through my repository, they are a showcase of my abilities when it comes to writing algorithms. See anything you like? Send me a message. Let's talk.

**Cheers!**
